Search Engine Optimization Home Work Assignment
So this was my first Homework Assignment. I had a couple of issues, the worst being trying to get the URL to work. For some reason my comp decided that it didn't like the original URL : https://jimgigantes.github.io/Search-Engine-Optimization-Homework/     Instead I had to add the .indez.html in order for it to work. https://jimgigantes.github.io/Search-Engine-Optimization-Homework/index.html     This is not my first time working on HTML. Its my first time with HTML 5 though so bear with me. 


ACs:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards                                                                         What I did within the HTML and CSS
WHEN I view the source code                                                                                    
THEN I find semantic HTML elements                                                                                 Included Header, footer, main, and aside                        
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements                                                                      
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning              I made sure that all the tags made sense and fit their location
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes                                                                       I added alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order                                                                                          Made sure they were in number order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title                                                                                      Provided. 


These Are the Acceptance Criteria That I was working with on this assignment. To the right I provide a description of what I did in order to satisfy the criteria.
